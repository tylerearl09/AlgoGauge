## About

AlgoGauge is a project created by Karl A, Caden S, and Tyler E for CS 4760. It's purpose is to allow the user compare and contrast different sorting and hashing algorithms using different parameters to see in real time the performance of each algorithm. The project is built using the MERN stack with a React Front End and a Node/Express backend that runs C++ code comparing and contrasting different algorithms. The C++ code then returns a JSON object that is passed along to the React Front end.
